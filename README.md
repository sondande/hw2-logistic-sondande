# hw2-logistic
HW2: Logistic Regression

This assignment contains four data sets that are based on four publicly available benchmarks, each representing a binary classification task:

1. monks1.csv: A data set describing two classes of robots using all nominal attributes and a binary label.  This data set has a simple rule set for determining the label: if head_shape = body_shape âˆ¨ jacket_color = red, then yes (1), else no (0). Each of the attributes in the monks1 data set are nominal.  Monks1 was one of the first machine learning challenge problems (http://www.mli.gmu.edu/papers/91-95/91-28.pdf).  This data set comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MONK%27s+Problems

2. banknotes.csv: A data set describing observed measurements about banknotes (i.e., cash) under an industrial print inspection camera.  The task in this data set is to predict whether a given bank note is authentic or a forgery.  The four attributes are each continuous measurements.  The label is 0 if the note is authentic, and 1 if it is a forgery. This data set comes the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication

3. occupancy.csv: A data set of measurements describing a room in a building for a Smart Home application.  The task in this data set is to predict whether or not the room is occupied by people.  Each of the five attributes are continuous measurements.  The label is 0 if the room is unoccupied, and a 1 if it is occupied by a person.  This data set comes the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+

4. seismic.csv: A data set of measurements describing seismic activity in the earth, measured from a wall in a Polish coal mine.  The task in this data set is to predict whether there will be a high energy seismic event within the next 8 hours.  The 18 attributes have a mix of types of values: 4 are nominal attributes, and the other 14 are continuous.  The label is a 0 if there was no high energy seismic event in the next 8 hours, and a 1 if there was such an event.  This data set comes the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seismic-bumps
